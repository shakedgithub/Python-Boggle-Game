# Boggle-Game
This project is an implementation of the classic word game Boggle.

The game is split into three parts: BOGGLE LOGIC, BOGGLE GUI, and BOGGLE CONTROLLER.

## BOGGLE LOGIC

This file contains the core logic for the game, including the creation of the game board,
checking for valid words, and keeping track of the player's score.

## BOGGLE GUI

This file is responsible for creating the graphical user interface for the game,
including the display of the game board and the score.

## BOGGLE CONTROLLER

This file acts as the controller for the game, connecting the logic and the GUI to make the game functional.

## Specials Features:

- A feature that provides positive feedback to the user for successfully discovering long words relative to the size of the game board.

- An feature that provides immediate feedback that notifies the user of the
 validity of discovered words upon submission.

- The game strictly enforces the rule of proximity between selected letters,
 ensuring compliance with traditional gameplay.

- The game offers the capability for the user to initiate a new game at their discretion.

- A feature that incorporates a scrollbar for the display of discovered words,
 accommodating up a large number of words found.

- A functionality that allows the user to view their score from the previous game session.
